# ide

ide mode for emacs. Minor mode that uses a solution file to perform various
operations on files in the solution. It enables you to:

    - Quickly navigate through files in the solution. Also supports visual
      assist style M-o command to switch between header and cpp files.

    - Quickly grep inside all files in the solution, or only files in a project
      in the solution.

    - Compile files in the solution or only in a project (Only supports visual
      studio for now).
